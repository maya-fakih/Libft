This project serves to help students understand the logic and algorithms behind standard functions everyone uses wether in c languages or in higher based ones like python...
This project is a great starting point for nontecnical people wanting to learn about coding and development, as well as university students or junior devs who want to know more about the why their code actually works the way it does. 
Follow along this journey to rediscover the tech world together :)
